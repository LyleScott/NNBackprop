In this example, a Neural Network uses backpropagation to "learn" XOR and to
later identify if two inputs are a valid XOR pair or not.

This may seem trivial, but for neural networks this problem is historic. XOR
is not linearly differentiable, which makes it impossible for the 2-layer
neural network to learn.

XOR Truth Table
input1  input2  output1
0       0       0
0       1       1
1       0       1
0       0       0
